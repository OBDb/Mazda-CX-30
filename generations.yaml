    description: "The Mazda CX-30 was introduced as a new model positioned between the subcompact CX-3 and the compact CX-5 in Mazda's crossover lineup. Built on the same platform as the fourth-generation Mazda3, it features sophisticated Kodo design language with clean surfacing, minimal character lines, and distinctive proportions. The exterior showcases Mazda's premium approach with sleek LED lighting, a dignified front fascia, and tasteful body cladding to enhance its crossover character. Initially powered by a standard 2.5L SkyActiv-G four-cylinder engine producing 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available with either front-wheel drive or i-Activ all-wheel drive. For 2021, the lineup expanded to include a turbocharged 2.5L option producing up to 250 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque with premium fuel. The interior represents one of the most upscale offerings in its class, featuring high-quality materials throughout, minimalist design with driver-focused ergonomics, and exceptional attention to detail. Technology includes a standard 8.8-inch center display controlled by an intuitive rotary commander, available 12-speaker Bose premium audio system, and head-up display. Safety features come standard through the i-Activsense suite including automated emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and driver attention alert, with higher trims adding traffic sign recognition and rear cross-traffic braking. For 2022, all-wheel drive became standard on turbocharged models, and the Carbon Edition with unique styling elements was introduced. Overall, the CX-30 embodies Mazda's upmarket strategy by offering near-luxury quality, design, and driving dynamics at mainstream pricing, successfully bridging the gap between the smaller CX-3 and the larger CX-5 while providing a higher seating position and more ground clearance than the Mazda3 hatchback with which it shares much of its architecture."
